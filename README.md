# sbitx-clickfix
sBitx test software to attempt a fix for noise bursts heard when transitioning from receive to transmit.

The location for the wisdome files has been changed from the current execution directory to /home/pi/sbitx/data. This may result in a 1 minute delay the first time the program is started, while the new wisdom files are generated. The startup delay is a one time occurrence and will not happen again once the wisdom files have been generated.
